                            control repositories like Git, SVN, or Mercurial, to provide insights and metrics about the
                            codebase. The analyzer
                            may analyze the repository's source code, commit history, and related metadata to identify code
                            quality issues,
                            performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and other areas for improvement. The analyzer can

                            web interface or a plugin, to provide real-time feedback and monitoring of code changes.</p>
